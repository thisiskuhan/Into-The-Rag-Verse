## ðŸ§‘ About the Author

**Kuhan Sundaram (@thisiskuhan)**  
AI/ML Engineer | Bangalore, India

Hello world! Iâ€™m an AI/ML engineer based in Bangalore, exploring Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), multimodal AI, and related technologies. This blog is my journal, where I share learnings, insights, and experiments from the exciting world of AI.

The content is original â€” ChatGPT only helped fix my absurd grammar! My hope is to guide those new to RAG in building an intuition for how it works. Whether you're just starting or deep-diving into advanced concepts, there's something here for everyone.
